make a website for @CodeFromAnywhere Agent: an AI SWE that solves any issue on public repos on GitHub.

Site is minimalistic and bold.

> input an issue URL
> click "give it a go"

Then you'd get an alert "I'll take a look" and redirect to the issue.

Use HTML, TailwindCDN and JS and make it look super modern bold and simple. super huge header and only a subtitle and the form is enough

Please make it look more like a professional landingpage with cool effect
