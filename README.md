# Li'l Issues

It's basically uithub resolve but authenticated and with paywall. When you activate it, it requires a $1 payment to try it for the issue. It works fully through the @CodeFromAnywhere GitHub and only in public repos with less than 50k tokens.

The only thing you can do on the website is paste an issue and click 'give it a go'.

Funny experiment!

Keep it small initially and make it open source. People must be able to self-host this on githuq via a simple link providing their own credentials and then boom they have a github bot that can make them money.
