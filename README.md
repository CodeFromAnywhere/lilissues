# ðŸ‘¶ Li'l Issues

It's basically uithub resolve but authenticated and with paywall. When you activate it, it requires a $1 payment to try it for the issue. It works fully through the @CodeFromAnywhere GitHub and only in public repos with less than 50k tokens.

The only thing you can do on the website is paste an issue and click 'give it a go'.

Funny experiment!

Keep it small initially and make it open source. People must be able to self-host this on githuq via a simple link providing their own credentials and then boom they have a github bot that can make them money.

- came up with concept, landingpage and name
- bought [domain](https://lilissues.com) and created [github account](https://github.com/lil-issues)

# Todo

This is exciting to look forward to, but let's not get carried away - I don't know yet if this is at all something people'd want, but could be great to experiment with this UX instead of with uithub directly.

Implementation won't take longer than a few hours so let's do it; for fun! But keep it real simple.
